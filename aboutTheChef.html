          <p>
              Hi! My name is Quentin Monasterial and I'd like to thank you so much for taking the time to check out some of my favorite dishes.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we can all agree that food is essential to our functioning as a human being, I also believe that food is essential in many other regards.
            My primary reason for chosing to share some of these dishes is to share with you a piece of my identity and culture. In this sense, food is often
            a gateway into what lays beyond our superficial idenetities.
          </p>

            Background
          </h3>
          <p>
            I was born in Southern California on October 28, 1998. I lived there for about 2 years before moving up
            to the Bay Area where I grew up and still live. More specifically, I grew up in San Leandro and currently reside in Fremont. While my experience in the kitchen doesn't
            extend far beyond scrambling eggs and mashing together a sandwich, I still consider myself a food aficionado.
          </p>
